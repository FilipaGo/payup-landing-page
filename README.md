## What is PayUp?

PayUp is a mobile app to manage shared expenses, receive and pay debts, without the need to expose banking information. All you need is a mobile phone number.

The project was developed with Lília Correia and Marta Casal, under a Postgraduate Diploma in Digital Experience Design.

> Our goal in creating PayUp is to help Millennials solve problems with splitting and tracking shared expenses, collecting and paying off debts among friends, by developing a mobile app that is better than MB WAY, Verse and Splitwise because it integrates into a single product the possibility to send and receive instant payments at any time, in a fast and easy way, without the need to disclose banking information, as well as track shared expenses. (Elevator Pitch)

## Designing the Landing Page

PayUp's marketing landing page targets Millennials, our product's target audience.

**Its' main goals are:**

* Converting new users into downloading the app (early adopters).
* Presenting the product's features and the solutions to the problems it solves;

**STEP 1 — Information Architecture**

Prior to creating wireframes, we mapped out the website's main structure. This process helped the team understand the website at a high level before getting into the details of the wireframes.

**STEP 2 — Content Strategy**

Before diving into the wireframes, we also worked iteratively on the content strategy and the copywriting for the landing page. This helped us think thouroughly about the sections and content blocks arrangement in order to effectively “sell” our product.

**STEP 3 — Wireframes**

The medium fidelity wireframes further explored how to present the content in a natural way, funneling the user into downloading the app.

To convert people more easily, we decided to place download CTAs on the top of the page but also at the end, after presenting the product and it's core features. This way, we both cater to users who are already familiar with PayUp and to those who have never heard of it.

**STEP 4 — Visual Design**

We settled for our base colour palette with two shades of blue and purple, trying to harmonize the app and the website's look and feel. We used grey for the text and plenty of light tones to keep the page clean.

During mockups stage we made some tweaks to the layout, going for a more edgy and funky vibe, more suitable for our users.

We also improved the copy and changed the main CTAs position by placing them inside the hero, which gave them more prominence and contrast.

Being a new product, we thought it would be wise to let people know what other users think about PayUp, so we added a slider with a couple of reviews to provide social proof.

**STEP 5 — Prototyping**

To easily present our solution in a more engaging way, we uploaded the mockups to InVision:

👉 Desktop version 🖥️ — https://filipago.github.io/payup-desktop-site-prototype/

👉 Mobile version 📱 — https://filipago.github.io/payup-mobile-site-prototype/

## Developing the Landing Page

I implemented the landing page using Webflow 🤟 and some custom code to:

* Build the feedback slider;
* Get the browser's width in order to responsively calculate the angled image's width on larger breakpoints;
* Prevent the body from scrolling when the mobile menu is open;
* Change the navbar on scroll;
* Improve the SEO...

I also used Slick Carousel and Sticky-js to build a more engaging feedback slider and control the placement of the mobile phone that showcases our app demo.

The main chalenge I faced during this stage was implementing the design as faithfully as possible to the pixel-perfect mockups.

## Next Steps

* Work on the remaining copy;
* Sketch, design and implement the remaining website pages;
* Get advice for writing the legal stuff; 🛡️
* Design the newletter;
* Test; 👎🏼 👍🏼
* Strengthen our social media marketing strategy.
