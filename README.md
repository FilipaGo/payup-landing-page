## What is PayUp?

PayUp is a mobile app to manage shared expenses, receive and pay debts, without the need to expose banking information. All you need is a mobile phone number.

The project was developed with LÃ­lia Correia and Marta Casal, under a Postgraduate Diploma in Digital Experience Design.

> Our goal in creating PayUp is to help Millennials solve problems with splitting and tracking shared expenses, collecting and paying off debts among friends, by developing a mobile app that is better than MB WAY, Verse and Splitwise because it integrates into a single product the possibility to send and receive instant payments at any time, in a fast and easy way, without the need to disclose banking information, as well as track shared expenses. (Elevator Pitch)

## Designing the Landing Page

The marketing landing page targets Millennials, our product's target audience.

Its' main goals are:

* Presenting the product's features;
* Converting new users into downloading the app.

## Developing the Landing Page

I developed the website using Webflow ðŸ¤Ÿ and some custom code to:

* implement the feedback slider;
* get the browser's width in order to responsively calculate the angled image's width on larger breakpoints;
* prevent the body from scrolling when the mobile menu is open;
* change the navbar on scroll;
* improve the SEO...

I also used Slick Carousel and Sticky-js.
