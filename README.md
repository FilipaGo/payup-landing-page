# PayUp App Landing Page

PayUp is a mobile app to manage shared expenses, receive and pay debts, without the need to
expose banking information. All you need is a mobile phone number.

The marketing landing page targets Millennials and its' main goals were presenting the product's features and converting new users into downloading the app.

ðŸ‘‰ Check it out at https://filipago.github.io/payup-landing-page/

I developed the website using Webflow ðŸ¤Ÿ and some custom code to implement the feedback slider, get the browser's width in order to responsively calculate the angled image's width on larger breakpoints, prevent the body from scrolling when the mobile menu is open, change the navbar on scroll, improve SEO... I also used Slick Carousel and Sticky-js.
